My name is StarChild and I am an information security professional with a complex background. Presently I am working as a Security Engineer. I have a focus in DevOps infrastructure and incident response. I am working on moving into leadership to better support my long term goals of diversity and ethics in tech. 

# My professional philosophy
1. People > Technology/Tools. People deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. Similarly just because something that a person does _can_ be replaced with technology does not always mean it _should_ be. 
2. We have a responsibility as an industry to engage with our organizations for creating more effective regulation for corporations. This also includes standing against anti-regulatory attempts lobbying by companies. 
3. Emergent theory is an essential component to the proper analysis and remediation of systemic problems.
