My name is StarChild. Professionally I am a InfoSec Leader. Vocationally I am a mentor, activist, and sex educator. I am also in charge of security for the [intentional community](https://housewayreth.substack.com/p/about-house-wayreth) that I am a part of. I also have this [introduction](https://chaos-cat.page/about%20me/Introduction/) post that I wrote if you would like to learn a bit more about that.
