My name is StarChild. I wear many hats, and have many jobs. Professionally I am a DevSecOps Engineer. Personally I am in charge of security for the [intentional community](https://housewayreth.substack.com/p/about-house-wayreth) that I am a part of. I also have this [introduction](https://open.substack.com/pub/housewayreth/p/introductions-starchild?r=gskqy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) post that I wrote if you would like to learn a bit more about that.
