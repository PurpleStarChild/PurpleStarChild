## Why did you make this site?
1. It is regularly expected for those looking to enter into the field of leadership to have a public presence. I have created this blog in part to help address that expectation.
2. I have thoughts on the tech industry that I would like to share that don't fit conveniently into the microblogging form factor.

## Where can I find more about your professional experience?
I have a [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexa-kelley/) that I try to keep relatively up to date. You can find most of my relevant work experience there.

## I have a potential job or project that I would like to talk to you about. How can I reach you?
My preferred method of contact is through [email](mailto:contact@chaos-cat.page). If you contact me via linkedin please be aware my response will likely be delayed. 
*note:* _be aware that I am not presently looking for a new position and I am limited on the number of extra projects I can take on._

## Why do you talk about political things on your blog?
To quote feminist theory _"The personal is the political."_ One of the downsides of the LGBTQ+ community being politicized and attacked is that means my existence becomes political. I do not have the luxury of not being political about these things as they have direct impacts upon myself, my loved ones, and others within the LGBTQ+ community.
