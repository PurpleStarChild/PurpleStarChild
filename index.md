I originally created this site as a professional blog. It was to serve as a place for me to share my thoughts on the industry, and the things I could share of my work. 

Since then my life has changed and the world has changed. I'm still figuring out what purpose this site will serve. However at the very least some of this is to serve as a landing page. If you're looking for my personal writings you can find them in the [blog](/blog/) section. Alternatively if you're wanting to learn more about myself and other places I am on the net, you can check out my [about me](/about/).
