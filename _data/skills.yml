# People Management
- skill: People Management
  description: Leadership is a strong factor in the success or failure of a team, and so I've invested my time in it heavily. I've focused particularly on compassionate leadership strategies, conflict resolution, and communication. At the end of the day I should be raising up the accomplishments of my team and celebrating them. 

# Security Management
- skill: Security Management
  description: I've had the fortune to learn security management in a wide variety of environments, from 100,000+ employee mega corporations to start-ups under 20 employees. However in them all it's been consistent that each company and department has different needs and the critical first step is identifying those needs and stakeholders. This enables the next steps of threat modeling and identifying risks & vulnerabilities. 

# Security Operations & Incident Response
- skill: Security Operations
  description: I've been doing security operations and incident repsonse since I began my work in security 15 years ago. I've analyzed activity of nation state actors, malicious users, and cybercrimals. I've also built two bespoke incident response functions for different companies.
