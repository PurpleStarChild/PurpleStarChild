resume_header_intro: "<p> As a security professional with nearly 15 years of experience, I have developed a diverse skill set encompassing security management, people management, security operations, cloud architecture, user-generated content, data analysis, systems theory, social VR/XR, and cyber intelligence.<br><br>

I thrive in environments where I am able to empower others on my team and can take a people first approach. 

<br><br>
My professional philosophies include:
<br>
  <ul>
<li> Treating people with respect and dignity.</li>
<li> Security teams function to support the rest of the company and should balance security needs carefully against development/business needs.</li>
<li> Prioritizing sustainable design and implementation for long-term success.</li>
<li> Maintaining a tool-agnostic approach where possible.</li>
<li> Team, community, and culture are defined by relationships between people and fostering these is crucial for success.</li>
<li> Embracing failure as a vital part of learning and growth.</li>
  </ul>
Seeking a security leadership role in Ireland with a company that values work/life balance and self-expression.
